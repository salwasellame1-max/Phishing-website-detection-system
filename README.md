## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on a comprehensive phishing URL dataset containing:

- **Phishing URLs**: Collected from PhishTank and other cybersecurity sources
- **Legitimate URLs**: Verified safe websites from trusted sources
- **Total Samples**: Approximately 10,000-50,000 URLs
- **Labels**: Binary classification (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Phishing)
- **Features**: URL-based characteristics extracted using TF-IDF

### Data Preprocessing
- URL text normalization
- Special character handling
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
- Train-test split for model validation

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

### 1. Logistic Regression (`phishing_lr.pkl`)
- **Algorithm**: Binary logistic regression classifier
- **Strengths**: Fast prediction, interpretable results
- **Use Case**: Primary model for real-time detection

### 2. Multinomial Naive Bayes (`phishing_mnb.pkl`)
- **Algorithm**: Probabilistic classifier
- **Strengths**: Works well with text features
- **Use Case**: Alternative model for comparison

### 3. Feature Extraction
- **Method**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- **Purpose**: Convert URL strings into numerical features
- **Saved As**: `vectorizer.pkl`

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salwasellame1-max/Phishing-website-detection-system.git
   cd Phishing-website-detection-system
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If `requirements.txt` is not present, install manually:
   ```bash
   pip install flask scikit-learn pandas numpy pickle-mixin
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the Web Interface**
   - Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5000`
   - Or: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## 💻 Usage

### Web Interface

1. **Launch the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Enter a URL**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser
   - Input the URL you want to check in the text field
   - Click "Check URL" or "Submit"

3. **View Results**
   - The system will display whether the URL is:
     - ✅ **Legitimate** - Safe to visit
     - ⚠️ **Phishing** - Potentially dangerous

### Example

**Input:**
```
http://paypal-secure-login-verify.com
```

**Output:**
```
⚠️ WARNING: Phishing URL Detected!
Risk Level: HIGH
Recommendation: Do not enter any personal information on this website.
```

**Input:**
```
https://www.google.com
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Legitimate URL
This URL appears to be safe.
```

### Using the Jupyter Notebook

To explore the model training process:

```bash
jupyter notebook url_detection.ipynb
```

## 📈 Model Performance

The models have been evaluated on test datasets with the following metrics:

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | ~95% | 0.94 | 0.95 | 0.94 |
| Multinomial Naive Bayes | ~92% | 0.91 | 0.93 | 0.92 |

*Note: Exact metrics may vary based on the dataset split and training parameters.*

### Key Insights
- Both models demonstrate strong performance in detecting phishing URLs
- Low false positive rate ensures legitimate sites are not incorrectly flagged
- High recall rate means most phishing attempts are successfully identified
